# Research Projects and Work

This repository contains various research projects, reports, presentations, and code related to my academic work. Below is a brief overview of the projects included.

Project 1: Circadian Rhythms in Lumbriculus variegatus
Folder Contents:

Poster

Report

Description:
This project focuses on studying clock protein expression in Lumbriculus variegatus (50 samples) to contribute to research on circadian rhythms. Using immunohistochemical staining with TIM and 5HT antibodies, I collected data at 6 different time points.

Key aspects of the project:

Conducted microsurgical dissections, including precise dorsal head amputations.

Produced successful results, indicating clock protein expression in brain and ventral nerve cord neurons.

Adapted and documented experimental protocols to improve reproducibility.

Collaborated with a lab partner to present our findings at an undergraduate research poster session and competition.

Project 2: Survival of Migration in Swainson’s Thrush

Slides

Report

Code

Description:
This research focuses on identifying traits that contribute to migration survival in Swainson’s thrush using a dataset of 500 samples. Machine learning models (Random Forest and MLP Classifier) were implemented in Python (sklearn), and statistical models (Probit and Multiple Logistic Regression) were used in R to predict migration survival.

Key aspects of the project:

Data preprocessing: removed entries with more than 50% null values, eliminated features with correlations above 0.75, and applied KNN imputation.

Applied SMOTE to balance the classes in the dataset.

Evaluated models via performance metrics using sklearn and pROC, interpreting results in a biological context.

Presented findings in weekly meetings, discussing methodologies, statistical analysis, and ecological implications.

Project 3: Graduate Defense - Turing Instability and Biological Applications
Folder Contents:

Slides

Description:
For my graduate defense, I delivered a technical presentation on Turing Instability and its applications in biological modeling. I focused on morphogenesis, pigmentation patterns, and ecological modeling using ODEs, PDEs, and linear stability analysis.

Key aspects of the presentation:

Applied reaction-diffusion equations to model pattern formation.

Analyzed Jacobian matrices and eigenvalues to determine steady-state stability in dynamical systems.

Explained the role of Laplacian operators and diffusion coefficients in pattern formation.

Explored the Gray-Scott model as an example of reaction-diffusion systems, demonstrating how small perturbations lead to pattern emergence.
