# Research Projects and Work

This repository contains various research projects, reports, presentations, and code related to my academic work. Below is a brief overview of the projects included.

### Project 1: Circadian Rhythms in Lumbriculus variegatus

* Report

## Description:
This project focused on investigating circadian rhythm mechanisms in Lumbriculus variegatus, an aquatic annelid worm. The aim was to examine the expression of the Timeless (TIM) protein, which plays a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythms in many organisms. The study involved performing immunohistochemical staining using TIM and 5HT antibodies across six time points in a 24-hour light-dark cycle, using 50 samples. The research aimed to uncover whether TIM protein expression follows a rhythmic pattern, and to identify its localization within specific tissues, particularly the brain and ventral nerve cord neurons. Additionally, microsurgical dissection techniques were employed, including dorsal head amputations to study tissue-specific protein expression.

## Key Aspects of the Project:
* **Objective:** To study the expression and rhythmicity of the TIM protein in Lumbriculus variegatus, contributing to circadian rhythm research.

* **Methodology:** Performed immunohistochemical staining at six time points across a 24-hour period, using TIM and 5HT antibodies to detect protein expression.

* **Experimental Design:** The worms were entrained in a light-dark cycle, and tissues were fixed at multiple time points for fluorescence microscopy.

* **Microsurgical Techniques:** Included precise dorsal head amputations to study the nervous system and underlying body structures.

* **Results:** The research successfully detected TIM protein expression in the ventral nerve cord, providing evidence of rhythmic expression that could inform future studies on circadian clock mechanisms.

* **Challenges:** There were ambiguities regarding the precise role of TIM, including potential evolutionary functions beyond circadian regulation, such as involvement in development or regeneration, which may be investigated in future studies.

* **Collaboration:** Worked closely with a lab partner and presented findings at an undergraduate research poster session and competition.

### This project contributes valuable insights into the understanding of circadian rhythm mechanisms, particularly in non-mammalian organisms like Lumbriculus variegatus, with potential implications for broader chronobiological research.

Project 2: Survival of Migration in Swainson’s Thrush

Report

Code

Description:
This research focuses on identifying traits that contribute to migration survival in Swainson’s thrush using a dataset of 500 samples. Machine learning models (Random Forest and MLP Classifier) were implemented in Python (sklearn), and statistical models (Probit and Multiple Logistic Regression) were used in R to predict migration survival.

Key aspects of the project:

Data preprocessing: removed entries with more than 50% null values, eliminated features with correlations above 0.75, and applied KNN imputation.

Applied SMOTE to balance the classes in the dataset.

Evaluated models via performance metrics using sklearn and pROC, interpreting results in a biological context.

Presented findings in weekly meetings, discussing methodologies, statistical analysis, and ecological implications.

Project 3: Graduate Defense - Turing Instability and Biological Applications
Folder Contents:

Slides

Description:
For my graduate defense, I delivered a technical presentation on Turing Instability and its applications in biological modeling. I focused on morphogenesis, pigmentation patterns, and ecological modeling using ODEs, PDEs, and linear stability analysis.

Key aspects of the presentation:

Applied reaction-diffusion equations to model pattern formation.

Analyzed Jacobian matrices and eigenvalues to determine steady-state stability in dynamical systems.

Explained the role of Laplacian operators and diffusion coefficients in pattern formation.

Explored the Gray-Scott model as an example of reaction-diffusion systems, demonstrating how small perturbations lead to pattern emergence.
